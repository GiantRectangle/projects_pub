usf = sqft of all rooms measured to inside face of exterior walls except as follows:
    take out the space of the space itself, as well as the perimiter walls for the following spaces:
        lateral support elements such as brace frames or shearwalls (note: don't take out columns or other walls)

        elevators
        shafts

    to measure the usf of a room, here's what you do:
        for exterior walls, measure to the inside face
        for corridor walls, measure to the corridor side
        for walls adjoining another room, measure to the center of the wall
        for walls of spaces not included in usf, measure to the room side (don't include the wall)

    "# Floorplate & number of floors unknown, we can provide a budget using only # of beds desired.Â \n",
    "# # of floors known & approximate floorplate provided (e.g. good sam certificate of need docs), we can provide a budget. In this case, floorplate is not truly a constraint yet. We should know if the program appears to fit or not.\n",
    "# Floorplate is known (e.g. existing shelled space, S&C already permitted, etc.), # of floors are known - we can provide a budget. Floorplate is a constraint, we can take it into consideration. Patient room sizes may be variable.\n",
    "# Similar to #3, but patient rooms are either drawn, or a hospital standard is provided that removes variability of patient room size.\n",
    "# We receive Schematic design drawings. All rooms & corridors are drawn to scale, no finishes or elevations provided. We customize the room sizes, our estimate fills in the gaps of information.\n",
    "# We receive DD drawings. Some finishes/elevations are provided. Our estimate serves to identify missing design info, functions as a check on materials/quantities.\n",
    "# From Schematic design through GMP, our model serves as the target value delivery path to budget. We can stand behind our budget, we have provided a detailed estimate of what is included in that number. Any/All variances in observations are put forth as decision points to get project back on budget.\n",
